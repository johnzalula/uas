This uas-ldap-sync.php script checks the UAS and LDAP for synchronisation errors.

For example if the LDAP server went down and the UAS was not able to push it's data to the server this script will notice it and push the 
user to LDAP.

This script works using LDAP and UAS modification timestamps, and they need to be therefor in time sync. If you are using different servers please use NTP. 
Ideally this script works best when the UAS / MySQL and LDAP are installed on the same server.

You could execute this script as any user using the crontab.

For example run it every hour. 

0 * * * * php /path/to/file/uas-ldap-sync.php

Make sure your email is set in the alias file on the server so you get notified of any errors.
